# MachineLearningCourseProject
where I uploaded my HTML file for the final project of the Machine Learning Course
To my reviewer:
Dear sir or madam
I am not sure this submission is going to arrive to you because I find this Github application a kind of labyrinth!!
This is the second time I find the submission more complicated than the project itself. The first one was during the regression
course.
In case you would be able to see the two files, one is the R file and the other is the HTML one. 
Thank you.
